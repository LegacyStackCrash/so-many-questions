# So Many Questions!

This is a project for beginners to learn the basics of web development with HTML and JavaScript

The "Issues" outlined in this repository are in ordered steps for completing the project.  Once all issues have been completed, you should have a fully working program!

This project is simple:  The user types a simple yes/no question, and an automatic answer is returned.  The responses are stored temporarily in the browser's storage, and the user can Like or Delete a response if they so choose.

This is intended to help beginners understand some basic to intermediate concepts in JavaScript (and DOM manipulation), and also doubles as a way to help me with code reviews.

I welcome all contributions!  I believe that practice doesn't make perfect, but it does make you a heck of a lot better than you were before. So please give it a try, and don't give up!


Note: This repository is meant to be mostly empty so it doesn't give away any answers.  It does, however, give a lot of hints on how to complete the project. :)
